
# VeinScope â€“ Tear Vein Pattern Analysis using Image Segmentation

__NOTE__ to run the code download ckpts from this (link)[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uL3Ux3wCsoJWa9IPWf8ksGWLJQOvmWDi?usp=sharing] and save them inside ckpts folder


A collaborative AI project focused on detecting and segmenting tear vein patterns using deep learning-based image segmentation techniques and image processing. 

__Using__ 

SBVPI dataset consisting for 55 participants. a total of 1840 high defination closeup images of eye. With binary masks of Scleara and 128 masks for vein patterns

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

**VeinScope** aims to develop an AI pipeline for analyzing tear vein patterns from images. By using image processing and attention-based segmentation architectures, state-of-the-art YOLO models, this tool seeks to assist in medical diagnostics.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Preprocess and enhance images for better vein visibility.
- Train deep learning models for accurate vein segmentation.
- Train a model for Scleara segemntaion
- Develop post-processing methods to refine segmented outputs.
- Evaluate performance using metrics as IOU and Dice score
- Build an inference pipeline for real-world deployment at the backend
- And an apk in android studio for capturing images and for displaying result

## How to use

way 1: VeinScope app

using the apk to capture the image running the ai hosted on backend (which is onee of our system)

way 2: using stramlit 

to run locally and use webcamp of the system to capture images
